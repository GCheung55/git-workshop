# Git Workshop
This is the set of instructions, labs, and follow-along-with-the-instructor script for Matthew McCullough's Git courseware.

## Script
"The Git Workshop Student Instructions" file is meant as both a shortcut guide to the common workflows of Git as well as a series of steps you can copy-and-paste from to follow along as Matthew presents the class materials.
